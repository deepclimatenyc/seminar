 What is a convective parametrization?
=====================================
 A model aimed at getting the cloud-scale mass flux profile and the
corresponding turbulent tracer transport (e.g. turbulent vertical heat
flux _w'T'_ where _w'_ is vertical
velocity turbulent anomaly and _T'_ is temperature turbulent
anomaly). Typical convective parametrizations rely on a lot of
assumptions:
 -   Specify mass flux at cloud base
 -   Specify entrainment and detrainment profiles
 -   Invoke a quasi-equilibrium assumption
 -   Based on a connection between boundary layer and convection.
 -   Can then add a triggering function preventing convection from
    triggering every time the static stability is negative (e.g. over
    land)
 Pathologies of man-made convective parametrizations:
 -   _[Bechtold et al., 2014]_ Problem of diurnal precipitation
    peak over land (e.g. peak too early, no late-night convection)
 -   _[Couvreux et al., 2015]_ Bias in the convective heating
    profile.
 -   Other problems include convective memory and short-time scale
    behavior.
 -   Quasi-equilibrium closure imposes too short timescales over land.
 -   Entrainment depends on environmental conditions in practice, for
    instance would increase when relative humidity increases in reality.
 -   Furthermore, entrainment is a stochastic process (dependence on
    stochastic mixing rather than solely cloud base conditions, since
    the memory of cloud base conditions is quickly lost).
 -   Convective parametrizations tend to trigger convection too
    frequently and too little ("drizzle problem”), which means that
    precipitation extremes are ill-resolved (typically top 1%
    precipitation extremes).
 -   Cannot simulate mesoscale convective systems, which are mesoscale
    (~100km) precipitation clusters that bring most of the high-impact
    precipitation events.
 -   When the atmosphere precipitates, some of the precipitation
    re-evaporates, which cools the atmosphere and triggers gravity
    currents. These gravity currents can trigger convection remotely and
    therefore organize convection.
 Although progress can be made by introducing a lag in the response of
the boundary layer or parametrizing cold pools, the limits of convective
parametrizations limit our ability to predict the changes in cloud
radiative effects and precipitation with climate, even in an aquaplanet
configuration (e.g. _Stevens, Bony 2013_). These limitations
impede our ability to predict regional climate change.
 Super-parametrization of convection
===================================
 Cloud-permitting models
-----------------------
 Cloud-permitting models (~1-10km horizontal resolution) can resolve
convective processes, and therefore correct many of the biases intrinsic
to convective parametrizations. Examples include:
 1.  The diurnal cycle of precipitation over the Amazon (convective
    parametrizations typically underestimate the precipitation intensity
    in this case)
 2.  Captures the magnitude of surface precipitation extremes in
    mid-latitudes (e.g. Oklahoma)
 What is super parametrization?
------------------------------
 It is possible to embed two-dimensional cloud-permitting models in
global climate models to better resolve the convection-equilibrated
thermodynamic tendencies. This considerably reduces the biases in moist
large-scale circulations as well as precipitation patterns
(macro-statistics of convection). However, certain aspects of
convection, such as momentum transport, cannot be represented because
the embedded cloud-permitting model is not three-dimensional. Because
the macro-statistics are better represented, mesoscale radiation
patterns, cold pools, etc. can be studied in the context of climate
models.
 Limits of super-parametrization
-------------------------------
 Because the cloud-permitting model is doubly periodic, it cannot
properly simulate mesoscale disturbances such as mesoscale convective
complexes, but they can resolve the winds necessary to advect them.
Furthermore, they are very expensive (more than 100 times the cost of a
regular global climate model).
 A data-driven approach: Machine learning to represent convection
================================================================
 Setup
-----
 The idea is to use the wealth of data available from super-parametrized
global climate models to train a network that takes as inputs:
 -   The temperature profile
 -   The specific humidity profile
 -   The surface pressure
 -   The surface enthalpy fluxes
 -   The top-of-the-atmosphere shortwave radiative flux
 and predicts the physical tendencies due to convection as outputs:
 -   The temperature tendency profile due to both convection and
    radiation
 -   The moisture tendency profile
 -   The precipitation
 -   The top-of-the-atmosphere radiative flux
 The cost function during the training phase is the mean square error of
the output vector.
 Results using the super-parametrized community atmospheric model
----------------------------------------------------------------
 The mesoscale precipitation and circulation features are well
reproduced, as well as the heating and moistening profiles. Once
embedded in the climate model to parametrize convection, the neural
network decreases the exaggerated Kelvin wave signal and has a good
Madden-Julian Oscillation signal.
 Predictive abilities
--------------------
 Although the initial aquaplanet training data set did not have any
longitudinal asymmetry, the neural network was able to predict a Walker
circulation once zonal asymmetries were introduced. Furthermore, the
neural net parametrization also significantly reduces the double
Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) bias. There are limitations if
the neural net is out of its training dataset: For instance, if trained
on past climates, it cannot reproduce the future (+1K,+2K,+3K,+4K)
climates (e.g. double ITCZ, etc.). If trained on the past (+0K) and
future (+4K) climate, then it can properly interpolate in between
(+1K,+2K,+3K). In conclusion, it is possible to represent sub-grid scale
processes given only coarse-grained values, although some of the
stochastic variability is missing (e.g. problematic for weather
predictions).
 Story of the making/Discussion
==============================
 Neural network characteristics
------------------------------
 -   The workflow evolved from the Tensorflow to the Keras library for
    the deep learning scripts
 -   Only requires 3-6 months of data to train the neural network, which
    opens the possibility of using large eddy simulation data to train
    even better neural network parametrizations
 -   256 x 8 layer neural network
 -   Using a convolution network did not improve the predictive abilities
 -   Non-dimensionalizing the data did not help either; the neural
    network seems to learn the non-dimensionalization by itself
 -   The cost function was simply the RMSE from the output vector
 -   Most of the results were insensitive to the output normalization
    decisions
 -   The learning rate was the most important hyper-parameter
 Neural-net global climate model performances
--------------------------------------------
 -   There is less and less skill near the surface as quantified by mean
    square error, but the neural-driven climate models produce
    reasonable signals when coupled one way with a land model.
 -   Conservation properties almost satisfied: the neural network seems
    to be able to “learn” physical laws to some extent
 -   Runs 20 times faster than the super-parametrized model
 Issues
------
 -   Stability problems, especially when trying to extend to the 32
    column version of SPCAM
 Future directions
-----------------
 -   Using three-dimensional data to train the network
